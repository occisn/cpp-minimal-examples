# cpp-minimal-examples

Four minimal C projects:  
A. one-file program without tests  
B. one-file program with tests  
C. project without test  
D. project with tests

They include `.clangd`, `.clang-format`, `Makefile` and `compile_commands.json` files so that everything work on my Windows configuration while leveraging Emacs ([my configuration file](https://github.com/occisn/emacs-config)) as a C++ IDE.
